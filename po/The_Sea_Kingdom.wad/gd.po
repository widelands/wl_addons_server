"This map has been designed especially for naval invasions. Each player "
"starts on their own Summer island with three port spaces and no gold. There "
"are three Desert islands with gold deposits and one port space each. Every "
"port space on the map is embedded in a terrain configuration that a wise "
"player can use to their advantage in the sea battles that will surely come. "
"Each of the six islands has one artifact."
