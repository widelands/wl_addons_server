"Important !! This Map depends on foreign_planet.wad by Nordfriese.   This is "
"the Second Planet to be inhabited by Humans.      There have been previous "
"attempts at colonizing these land areas.  There are adequate minerals, "
"flora , fauna and aquatic life on the two main land masses. However, there "
"is a complete lack of Gold on these areas.     Previous pioneers have "
"transported a small quantity of Gold from the Volcanic islands and buried it "
"in small mines close to the water's edge. They have market these mines with "
"Standing Stones.  The pioneers also used Standing Stones to mark some of the "
"good fishing areas."

"Due to the Gold restrictions on the Main Lands, it is recomended that you do "
"not begin to build your Army before you establish a Gold mine on a Volcanic "
"Island.  Locate your local man made Gold mine and build the Port that is "
"close by. There is enough Gold in this mine to build several ports. Build a "
"couple of ships and explore the Volcanic islands.  Secondly, in order to "
"access the islands in the second large body of water, you need to build a "
"port on that side of your domain and build a second fleet of ships."
