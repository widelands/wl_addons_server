"can you survive without resources surrounded by six hostile forces? can you "
"outproduce seven opponents when you have every possible disadvantage?  "
"Intended to give a big challenge to a human (blue) playing 1v7 against AI. "
"It makes no sense otherwise.     HINTS: follow the dry riverbed to the sea. "
"make a port, settle the islands. you have no coal, so you'll need charcoal "
"burners. the enemies have more resources than you, so you should be fast in "
"killing them. standing stones in the starting valley indicate resources. "
"Play this map only if you are really good, or suicidal."

"A map for solo challenge. You start from the middle, and you gradually fight "
"your way outside. At every ring you will find a new enemy, each stronger "
"than the previous one. Kill them fast: every ore your opponent digs from the "
"mines is one less ore that you will have to fight the next ring. But you "
"will also have to fight with your stretching logistics. Port spaces are "
"under the enemy headquarters."

"This is an excercice in building an economy over long distances, not at "
"finding small islands in a large ocean like needles in a haystack. For that "
"reason, you can find the 20 islands by following the paths of darker water. "
"They are also numbered for the player's convenience.  Minable areas are "
"color-coded so that you don't need to bother with geologists."

"The stories say that once our tribe lived in the fertile land to the west, "
"where plants and crops grow and one does not need to dig deeply to  find "
"water. But the easy life made us weak and lazy. One day the invaders came "
"from the sea, and they conquered and pillaged, and they cast us out of our "
"land. The few survivors were forced to escape in the desert, where they have "
"struggled to survive ever since. But the stories speak of hope. They tell of "
"a wise leader that will come, one that will be able to tame the desert and "
"build a mighty civilization over it. A leader that will somehow find in this "
"barren place the resources to train a powerful army, and will lead it across "
"the high passes into the fertile land that we were forced to flee "
"generations ago, slaughter the invaders, who have grown soft in their "
"comfort like we did before them, and claim that land once again as ours!   "
"Has that leader finally arrived? "

"- This is a solo challenge map, with the blue player strongly "
"disadvantaged.  - There is no coal in the desert; you have to sustain "
"charcoal burners with the scant fertile land you have. That's the "
"challenge.  - Follow the water! Patches of fertile land indicate underground "
"streams; follow them to find the oasis."
