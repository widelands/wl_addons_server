"The last years were really dry. Fortunately, there is still enough water "
"coming from the mountains so we are able to irrigate our fields. It seems "
"inevitable that our beautiful Noon Lake will turn into a desert at some "
"point in the future. We should build an empire, now or never. Our "
"descendants will live in desert but they will be proud of the fact how "
"powerful and vibrant their homeland once was."

"This map is for 2 to 6 players. But 3 or 4 players are probably more "
"optimal. There are only few spots where you can build bridges across the "
"wide rivers and few mountain passes. The map is rich in resources. This is "
"an improved and more balanced version of the original Great Danube Basin map."
