"The last years were really dry. Fortunately, there is still enough water "
"coming from the mountains so we are able to irrigate our fields. It seems "
"inevitable that our beautiful Noon Lake will turn into a desert at some "
"point in the future. We should build an empire, now or never. Our "
"descendants will live in desert but they will be proud of the fact how "
"powerful and vibrant their homeland once was."
