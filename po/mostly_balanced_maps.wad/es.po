"We have found an ideal land for our farms and woodcutters. Surrounded by "

"Finally! You have reached the far south and set up a base, but it seems that "
"the Old Antarctic itself is still not very close. It is told that the land "
"is so rich that gold stones cover its coast. You have to cut down some trees "
"and build a ship to continue your journey. Otherwise, there will be no "
"precious gold left for you. You may also run out of coal very soon. Your "
"expedition is not the only one that strives to gain the fabulous wealth and "
