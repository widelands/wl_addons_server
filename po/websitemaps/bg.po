"For the first time, I made a map that is both a solo challenge and nice to "
"look at. The original inspiration for this map was an idea about putting "
"one's starting position is a desert and force him to deal with the lack of "
"good terrain to grow trees. I even fancied putting a script that makes wells "
"not produce except in a few chosen locations, and that will periodically "
"drain water stored in your warehouses, and would kill your workers if there "
"is not enough water, so that in the game you'd have to actively fight "
"thirst. Alas, I don't even know how to start writing a script, so the idea "
"remained in the back of my mind.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Then, at some point, wandering on google earth I came across the Tibesti "
"mountains, in central Sahara. I was fascinated by how water interacted with "
"the mountain desert environment; the dry desert air cools as it climbs the "
"mountains, and the cold squeezes out what little moisture there is. The rain "
"is quickly absorbed under the sand, but it keeps flowing underground, "
"feeding a network of oasis in a radius of hundreds of kilometers. On the "
"surface it's dry sand, but in some places the water comes close to the "
"surface, giving rise to apparently inesplicable patches of vegetation in the "
"middle of a dry valley. This merged with my previous idea, and so this map "
"was conceived. Notice how the mountains where the blue player starts are "
"volcanic in origin.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The idea was still that of actually making it out of the desert and "
"conquering the tribe that had the better land. But why is there such a dry "
"place and close to it one with abundant rains? Enter the big mountain range "
"to cast a rain shadow, with the desert on the east and the fertile land to "
"the west, near the sea. Since I had a mountain range near the sea, I decided "
"to also add some fjords to it. I don't suppose it is possible to have a hot "
"desert and fjords nearby - fjords only form near the poles, and in the time "
"the continental drift bring them to the tropics, the fjords are wheatered "
"down. Still, they look nice. You can pretend it's a cold desert, like the "
"mongolian steppe, if you like a more consistent explanation. The two big "
"rivers uniting near the mouth to form an even bigger river is inspired by "
"the Shatt al-Arab, and the delta by the Po delta. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"As a challenge map, it's fairly easier than my other maps. You need to be "
"good to win, but unlike my most recent challenges (no metal challenge and "
"concentric rings) this map is not made to take an extremely strong player "
"and make him curse at the monitor for days of trial and error.\r\n"

"thinking about it, I decided that I liked this feature as a way to introduce "
"new strategies: you can defend on only one side, but to attack you must go "
"both ways. Most important, in that map large building slots are so scarce "
"that nobody was using one for a castle anyway, especially since their main "
"advantage, i.e. difficult to see by the enemy, is promptly negated by the "
"ease of building towers. So I wanted to keep this factor as a way to give "
"players a meaningful decision on whether to use that new large space for a "
"castle, or to make a new farm. On the down side, situations when both "
"players are conquering on one side and racing to kill the opponent first, "
"which were common in the tournament, would be much less difficult to see, so "
"it wasn't an easy decision. But anyway, I had to ensure that this blocking "
"feature worked for all players, because it didn't. So I moved the shoreline "
"a bit in some places.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Other minor stuff I did: fixing some mountain slopes so that it would be "
"easier to make mines on them; made a stretch of sand on the blue player's "
"side so that, if in the future short waterways with carriers on boats will "
"be implemented like they were in settlers 2, both players will have an equal "
"possibility to use them; changed a bit of coast that accidentally gave one "
"player a few more building spaces than the other; done a few small aesthetic "
"changes to the terrain height and the snow cap; changed the hints stating "
"that empire was disadvantaged because, after version 1.1  added a lot of "
"fish, empire can finish the game without piggeries and is therefore no "
"longer disadvantaged; changed the map description to one that I liked more; "
"added my signature to the map, to sate my megalomania :)\r\n"

"for you, there are seven other variants of this card. From beginner-friendly "

"Here is a BIG map for those who like VERY long single player games :-) \r\n"
"\r\n"
"Actually I did build this map with those who play on-line in mind. There are "
"8 tribes possible with this map; It is also very large - 512 X 512. I have "
"set up three large islands and some smaller ones just for resources "
"[Gold :-)]. This map also has my signature landing ports that guarantee a "
"safe initiation of an invasion of another tribe by ship. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"This has taken a couple of months to build and incorporates all of the map "
"building skills that I have learned. Again I would like to thank everyone "
"for their effort in building such an amazing game. Special thanks to those "
"who have given me valuable help with how to use the editor.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I have thoroughly tested the landing ports as well as completely capturing "
"the whole of one island. I did not focus on the precise time I spent but the "
"last 6 days have been pretty much devoted to playing this map at speed 6 "
"[Normally I play at speed 1 and enjoy watching my tribe living their "
"lives :-)]. I wanted to get this map ready for upload before the end of the "
"year."
