"The four mighty harbors of the Craw Islands have been trading their goods "
"among each other for ages. All of them needed resources that they could not "
"produce in their own territory and in exchange provided other resources to "
"those that could not produce them. Based on these trades, a very friendly "
"commerce was common between the four harbors and the people living on the "
"Craw Islands – until recently, when two of the harbors united to form an "
"exclusive trade alliance, forcing the other two to do the same. Suddenly, it "
"seems only a matter of time before the first fights between the harbors will "
"shatter the peaceful life that has lasted for so long…"
