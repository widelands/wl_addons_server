"The British imperium transported huge amounts of criminals to a new "
"continent soon after it was found at 17th. century. The imperial ships "
"abandoned you and all the other criminals it has to this barren, strange new "
"world. Your heroic decision is to bring order to the rows of the criminals "
"and to create your own prosperous country full of life."

"The story is written with normal letters and INSTRUCTIONS WITH CAPSLOCK ON. "
"Barbarians or atlanteans are the best fit for maori and thus suggested to be "
"used for that. Play with empire. ---------------------- It is year 1840 and "
"you, Captain William Hobson, are chosen to be the first governor of Aotearoa "
"- or New Zealand as we call it. Over the past fourty years an intertribal "
"Musket wars have ravaged the land. As more and more british settlers arrive "
"to settle the land, there's an ever stronger need to make some kind of "
"contract with chieftains to avoid fights between them and settlers. Many "
"tribes also see this as a chance to end tribal wars and gaining of "
"protection from the other colonial power. It is your duty to draft an "
"acceptable contract and gain signatures from each chieftain under it.  "
"EPISODE ONE - PLAY FROM BLUE PLAYER'S LOCATION AND TRY MEET EACH CHIEFTAIN "
"BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. SELECT ARTEFACTS AS THE PLAYING MODE. THERE ARE "
"ELEVEN ARTEFACTS VISIBLE TO THE SHORE AND EACH ARTEFACT REPRESENTS A MEETING "
"POINT WHERE YOU CAN GAIN A SIGNATURE FROM ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS. MAKE AN "
"EXPEDITION AND FIND THOSE PLACES. THEN DECIDE WHICH ONE TO PURSUE FIRST, "
"SECOND, THIRD, ETC. BE QUICK, IT GETS HARDER OVERTIME. IF AN ARTEFACT IS "
"ALREADY STRONGLY UNDER SOME OTHER TRIBES' CONTROL, THAT LEADER HAS DONE HIS "
"DECISION AND IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO NEGOTIATE. DO NOT ATTACK, ONLY DEFEND "
"IF NECESSARY. YOU CAN PLAY THIS IN PEACEFUL MODE OR WITH HOSTILITIES. THERE "
"ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUCCESS OUTLINED FOR BOTH VERSIONS IN THE END OF "
"THIS DESCRIPTION. WITH HOSTILE ADVERSARIES YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PURSUE EITHER "
"HIGHEST TEMPORARY AMOUNT OF OWNED ARTEFACTS OR HIGHEST WHEN ALL OF THE "
"ARTEFACTS ARE UNDER SOMEONE'S CONTROL. REGARDLESS OF HOW IT ENDS, YOU CAN "
"CONTINUE TO EPISODE TWO IF YOU LIKE. ---------------------- Unfortunately "
"the contract had a major flaw built in it as maori language lacked one "
"crucial word - governance. It did not take long until the contract was "
"contested, resulting in terrible loss of trust. Series of wars between "
"british empire and maori ensued with a result of about million hechtares of "
"land lost to the crown. Majority of these wars were fought on north island "
"between 1860-1870.  EPISODE TWO - CHOOSE WHICHEVER START LOCATION YOU LIKE, "
"ALTHOUGH RED, WHITE OR ORANGE ARE SUGGESTED. YOU CAN SELECT ALL VS. ALL OR "
"YOU VS. ALL. DISABLE BLUE PLAYER'S STARTING LOCATION IF YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE "
"IT. CHOOSE MAJORITY OF LAND AS WIN CONDITION. IN THIS SCENARIO GAINING "
"MAJORITY MEANS THAT THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION SURRENDERS. MOST PROPABLY YOU "
"CAN'T WIN WITHOUT HAVING SOME AREAS FROM THE OTHER ISLANDS AS WELL. "
"----------------------- The map might also be suitable for multiplayer with "
"the following configuration: Disable blue and white players' start location "
"and play all vs. all or with two or three teams. With two teams the "
"strongest player of the team must be alone on the other island and two "
"weaker players on the other. "
"---------------------------------------------------------- LEVELS OF SUCCESS "
"FOR THE FIRST EPISODE - PEACEFUL MODE - 4-5 -Did you really try? No wonder "
"it all ended in war. 6-7 -You did at least something right, even though it "
"all still ended in war. 8-9 -You coerced them well, but unfortunately the "
"peace won't last. 10 -Exellent job! Just one full tribe of doubters will "
"send your efforts down the drain. 11 -Unbelieveable! Is it even possible? "
"You should have cheated somehow.. - HOSTILE MODE - 2 -Poor job. The war is "
"propably already underway.. 3 -Not much to celebrate. 4 -Well done in the "
"middle of violence. 5 -Exellent. You should be proud if you never attacked. "
"6 -Unbelieveable dance on the edge of a blade - and just defending!"

"There are some ''buffer zone'' areas designed to be hard for computer "
"players to conquer - leading to some more variance to the play along with "
"other benefits. If you get stuck, demolish some smaller buildings from the "
"problematic location and check if there can be a big building instead. Some "
"areas are also designed to be impasses with alternative path around them. "
"Unlike in Tasmanian Black War, on this map a player can sail round it. "

"Welcome intruder! You're like an european conqueror from an early 1800's "
"when they settled the Van Diemen land - later known as Tasmania. Between "
"1828-1832 there was a war called Black War in which british empire "
"eradicated almost an entire aboriginal population from the Van Diemen land.  "
"The map simulates a scattered british empire but without any advantages - "
"actually it offers some great disadvantages and you will likely have a hard "
"time conquering Tasmania. During the historical Black War the ratio between "
"europeans and aboriginals was around one against ten but this time they're "
"armed to the teeth for a revance. --- Additional tags: challenge, strategic, "
"beautiful, real world area, scenario"

"This map is intended to be played as a single player scenario from blue "
"players' starting location. Choose barbarians for the rival tribes and play "
"with an empire. If you want to lose then put them all on the same side but "
"at least I prefer playing every man for himself with an end condition of 50% "
"land area control for 20 minutes. This map isn't suitable for short games "
"and one game will likely take more than ten hours. AI has great capability "
"on this map. One of the computer players will likely also begin seafaring "
"and competes from the best harbor places on the Tasmanian coastal, so you've "
"been warned!  "
