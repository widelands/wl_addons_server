description=_""Surreal valley deep below sea level, steep slopes full of minerals and fertile lands waiting down below - who wouldn't be tempted by such sights? Especially because you've mistakenly decided to settle onto such a desert peninsula. While working your path to the depths, the small fertile atolls might look economically smart opportunities too. But down there might not be all serenity as you've spotted some other ships and settlements - is it again time to fight for the riches? "
