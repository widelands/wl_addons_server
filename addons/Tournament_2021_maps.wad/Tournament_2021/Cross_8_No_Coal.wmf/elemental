descr=_"A single convoluted continent; with the starting positions near the centre. "
hint=_"Head away from the centre. I suggest victory condition = territorial lord (or Autocrat).  The map is made up of 4 large land masses, connected at the outer edge - at the middle of the North, South, West & East edges of the map. Beat the opposition to the 'connectors', and build a fortress etc, to block the other side's access, and you win."
