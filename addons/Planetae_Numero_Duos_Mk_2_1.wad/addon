name=_"Planetae Numero Duos Mk 2.1"
description=_"Important !! This Map depends on foreign_planet.wad by Nordfriese.   This is the Second Planet to be inhabited by Humans.      There have been previous attempts at colonizing these land areas.  There are adequate minerals, flora , fauna and aquatic life on the two main land masses. However, there is a complete lack of Gold on these areas.     Previous pioneers have transported a small quantity of Gold from the Volcanic islands and buried it in small mines close to the water's edge. They have market these mines with Standing Stones.  The pioneers also used Standing Stones to mark some of the good fishing areas."
