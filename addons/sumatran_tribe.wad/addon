name=_"Sumatrans"
description=_"Needs sumatran_world.wad. It uses partially graphics of other tribes, until new graphics is available. AI likes summer and desert terrain, a lot of space and water nearby. Fortified Village for a stronger opponent. More info in help and tips. If you use version 1.3 and newer and you combine this tribe with another add-on tribes, please make sure that this add-on is above them on the list of add-ons. Otherwise the crocodile hunter’s house for the other tribes doesn’t have to be uploaded."
