descr=_"The gods who created this piece of landscape must be crazy. They proove your skills in naval warefare and managing a big economy with long transportation routes. They also try to madden you in this labyrinth of mountains."
hint=_"Enabling Naval warefare is recommended. You have to sail the sea and build probably a lot of ports and shipyards until you reach your opponent. You might need to restrict the workarea of a shipyard by placing roads on the coast to force the shipbuilder to build ships on the wanted coast. The AI does not work very well on this map. "
