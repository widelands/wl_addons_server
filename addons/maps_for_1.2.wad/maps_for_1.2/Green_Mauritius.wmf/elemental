author="OIPUN"
descr=_"There are rather rocky hills than mountains on this island. But this untouched nature, home of many unique species like the well known bird Dodo, makes it a small paradise. Now, 4 colonial empires want to make this island their colony. And all 4 managed to do so for some period of time. But who will be the most successful. We will see soon."
hint=_"The map is balanced for 2 or 4  players. Orange player (Grand Bay) and Grey player (The City of Light) are optional. The first one has not enough resources near his base, the second one is in the middle of the map. This is a non-add-on version of the ''Tropical Mauritius'' map."
