descr=_"You have settled in a land of 7 lakes: Upper Lake, Crown Lake, Blueberry Lake, Frog Lake, Silver Lake, Great Crater Lake and the lowest Long Beach Lake. One lake is more beautiful than the other. Which one do you find the most beautiful? Conquer all of them and decide, which one is the most beautiful."
