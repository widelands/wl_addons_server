descr=_"This spring, after years of droughts, dark clouds came and left our mountains so green that even the oldest of our people don't remember times, when this land was so green. We should build some infrastructure now to prevent other tribes migrating to our land and using this newly gained wealth for themselves."
hint=_"It's an improved summer version of ''Atlas Range'' map. This map has limited space, a lot of resources, enough fishes, few rocks and trees and is easy to play. According to my testing, it should be well balanced too."
