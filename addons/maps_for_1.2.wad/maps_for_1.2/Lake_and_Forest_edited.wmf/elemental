descr=_"A lake in this forest separates two rivalling tribes."
hint=_"A tiny map for quick games. This map is rich in resources and balanced. AI doesn't perform well because the land around starting positions is not good for planting trees. Be careful, thanks to the lake, enemy seems to be far away, but as soon as he can see you, he should be able to attack you too."
