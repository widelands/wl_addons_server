descr="You are surrounded by six enemies with more space and resources than you. land offers you no opportunities, so you must build your empire among faraway small islands, scattered like dust in the wind. Can you make your economy work under those conditions?"
hint="This is an excercice in building an economy over long distances, not at finding small islands in a large ocean like needles in a haystack. For that reason, you can find the 20 islands by following the paths of darker water. They are also numbered for the player's convenience.  Minable areas are color-coded so that you don't need to bother with geologists."
