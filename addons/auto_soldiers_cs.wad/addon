name=_"Automatic Soldier Setting for Military Construction Sites"
description=_"If there is no enemy military building in sight, every new construction site is set to prefer rookies and reduce the capacity to 1. If there are enemy military buildings in sight prefer always heroes and set capacity to max. Once a player adjusted one of these settings, this script does nothing."
