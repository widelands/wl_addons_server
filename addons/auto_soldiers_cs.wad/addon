name=_"Automatic Soldier Setting for Military Construction Sites"
description=_"Configure new miliary construction sites automatically: If there is no enemy military buildiung in sight, every new construction site is set to prefer rookies and reduce the capacity to 1. If there are enemy military buildings in sight prefer always heroes and set capacity to max. Once a player adjusted one of these settings, this script does nothing. Note that a player has to observe the borders anyway."
