author="OIPUN"
descr=_"Since the north pole moved to Alaska, our land is an inhabitable desert. We sent few scouts to find a new land and we have received a message about Greenland. I have heard  about its beautiful fjords and fertile land. Although there is almost no iron and gold, I think it should be fine. We don’t need iron as long as we don’t need any army and we are not going to fight there. Let’s choose this place to be our new home and start a peaceful life."
hint=_"Ports are situated only by the inner lake. I recommend to use them only while played by 4 players or less. You have to use empty mines to get gold and iron in the later stages of the game."
