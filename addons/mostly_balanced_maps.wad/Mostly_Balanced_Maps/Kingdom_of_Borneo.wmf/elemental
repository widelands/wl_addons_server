descr=_"Our tribe as well as 7 other tribes has been living on this small islands for ages. But now our lives should change. Wise men of our tribe say that a new island has been found, very rich and large. They call it Kalamanthean. And this new land is promising cultural growth our tribe is missing. We just have to build a ship very quickly and sail north and west to reach this blessed land of welfare."
hint=_"Borneo is easy to recognize thanks to its white beaches. It has 10 port spaces and 13 artifacts. If you want to win, you should build a port there. AI should start with Trading Outpost. Map is more suitable for multiplayer. Each player has two port spaces on his home island."
