author="OIPUN"
descr=_"We don't have enough space and our headquarter is in danger here. We need to build a colony on the other side of this lake. We will gain more land and a hideaway in case an enemy appears on this side. But I am afraid we will not reach The Main Landbelt without fight."
hint=_"All players should start with a headquarters  only. There is not enough space around the starting position. Your territory is divided into two parts by a lake. You need a part of your enemy's territory to reach The Main Landbelt from where you can access to any corner of this map. You can also find 6 artifacts there. Your homeland is hard to defend. Protect it well."
