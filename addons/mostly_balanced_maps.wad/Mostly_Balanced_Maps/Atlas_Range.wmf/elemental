descr=_"High mountains offer limited space to settle. To survive in this hostile land, where even no wild life can be found, is not an easy task. You are grateful for every stone and a planted tree that can grow. Can you build a strong economy?"
hint=_"Teams: all combinations possible. AI: just AI Frisians is able to adapt quite well, AI Barbarians and Atlanteans mostly unable to develop, AI Empire and Amazons struggle a lot. AI should start with Trading Outpost in these cases. Human: Empire is at a disadvantage in training soldiers. Barbarians and Amazons have to be very quick and make the right decisions to have a chance. Atlanteans are missing fish and meat generally."
