author="OIPUN"
descr=_"This is The Great Danube World. The wide never ending river Danube and its tributaries Tisa, Sava and Drava created a wast lowland full of riparian forests surrounded by high peaks of Carpathians, Dinarides and Alps."
hint=_"This map is for 2 to 6 players. But 3 or 4 players are probably more optimal. There are only few spots where you can build bridges across the wide rivers and few mountain passes. The map is rich in resources."
