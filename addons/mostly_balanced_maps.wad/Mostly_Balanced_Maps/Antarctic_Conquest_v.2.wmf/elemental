descr=_"Finally! You have reached the Far South and set up a base, but it seems that the Old Antarctic itself is still not very close. It is told that the land is so rich that gold stones cover its coast. You have to cut down some trees and build a ship to continue your journey. Otherwise, there will be no precious gold left for you. You may also run out of coal very soon. Your expedition is not the only one that strives to gain the fabulous wealth and everlasting fame."
hint=_"Collectors and Territorial Lord recommended. Also suitable for peaceful mode. 2 teams are possible, yellow and blue should play against each other. When playing singleplayer, you have to count with the possibility that your opponents may not start an expedition at all and may rather choose a land path."
